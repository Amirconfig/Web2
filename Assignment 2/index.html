            <h4>Description About My Code</h4><br>
            <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, scripting programming language that is widely used to make dynamic, 
                interactive web pages. In my code, I have a JavaScript file named "math-practice.js" that is 
                included in the HTML file using the script tag. The script file contains the logic that will 
                control the behavior of the web page, such as handling user input, displaying questions, and 
                keeping track of the score. The JavaScript code interacts with the HTML elements on the page 
                by accessing and modifying their properties and values.</p><br>

            <p><strong>HTML</strong>, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. 
                Your code uses HTML to define the structure and content of the web page, including the header, 
                footer, and various other elements such as buttons, headings, and text. HTML elements are defined 
                using tags and are nested within each other to create the structure of the page. For example, I have 
                a div tag with the class <em>"grid-container"</em> that acts as a container for all other elements on the page. 
                The CSS file is used to control the visual appearance of the HTML elements.</p><br>

            <p>My JavaScript code implements a simple math practice. The code defines variables for different elements 
                in the HTML page such as <strong>the start button, questions, answers, score, and timer</strong> display. The code then 
                defines an array of questions and answers. The startPractice() function is called when the start button 
                is clicked and sets the display properties of various elements and starts a timer. The answers are 
                checked by the <em>checkAnswer()</em> function, and the score is updated based on the correct answers. The practice 
                restarts when the restart button is clicked.</p><br>

            <p>My HTML code for a webpage that displays a math practice application. The webpage consists of <strong>four main 
                sections, the header, question container, description, and footer</strong>. The header section displays the 
                title of the application, the author's name, and the purpose of the application.
                The question container section contains a button "Start Practice," which when clicked starts the math 
                practice. There are five questions that are displayed one at a time, and the user has two minutes to 
                answer them all. The section also displays the score, a restart button, and a timer.
                The code uses a CSS file named <em>"style.css"</em> and a JavaScript file named <em>" math-practice.js "</em> to style 
                the page and provide interactivity.</p>
