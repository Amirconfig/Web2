Description:  
This code creates a simple number guessing game in JavaScript. The script defines 3 global variables:
"totalWins", "totalLosses", and "totalGames".

The "getRandomNumber()" function returns a random number between 1 and 10 using the Math.floor() and 
Math.random() functions.

The "playGame(guess)" function takes a user's guess as a parameter and generates a random number using 
the "getRandomNumber()" function. It increments the "totalGames" variable and then checks if the user's 
guess is equal to the random number. If the guess is correct, it increments the "totalWins" variable and 
displays an alert saying "Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly." If the guess is incorrect, 
it increments the "totalLosses" variable and displays an alert saying "Sorry, the number was [random number]. 
Try again, GOOD LUCK with next guess."

The "startGame()" function prompts the user to enter a guess and calls the "playGame(guess)" function if the 
guess is a valid number between 1 and 10. If the user enters "exit", it displays an alert with the total wins, 
total losses, and total games played. If the user enters an invalid input, it displays an alert saying "Invalid 
input! Please try again and input only numbers between 1 and 10."

The "startGame()" function then calls itself recursively so the game can continue until the user enters "exit".
